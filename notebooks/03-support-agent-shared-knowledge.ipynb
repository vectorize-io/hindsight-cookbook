    "# Support Agent with Shared Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern shows how to build a support agent that combines **per-user memory** with **shared product knowledge** (RAG), giving users personalized support while leveraging a single source of truth for documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "You're building a support agent that needs to:\n",
    "- Remember each user's history, preferences, and past issues\n",
    "- Access shared product documentation\n",
    "- Keep user data completely isolated from other users\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive approach would index product docs into each user's memory bank, but this is expensive and wasteful (N copies for N users).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution: Multi-Bank Architecture\n",
