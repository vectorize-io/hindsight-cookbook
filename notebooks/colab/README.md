## Prerequisites

- **OpenAI API key** — for LLM responses
- **Hindsight API key** — sign up at [ui.hindsight.vectorize.io](https://ui.hindsight.vectorize.io)

## How It Works

The Colab notebooks connect to Hindsight Cloud at `https://api.hindsight.vectorize.io`, so you don't need to run anything locally. Just:

1. Click any "Open in Colab" badge above
2. Enter your API keys when prompted
3. Run the cells

## Notebooks

Each notebook demonstrates a different use case for Hindsight's memory capabilities:

- **movie_recommendation.ipynb** — Personalized movie recommender that learns your tastes
- **fitness_tracker.ipynb** — Fitness coach that tracks workouts, diet, and recovery
- **study_buddy.ipynb** — Study assistant with spaced repetition and knowledge gap tracking
- **personal_assistant.ipynb** — General-purpose assistant with long-term memory
- **healthcare_assistant.ipynb** — Health chatbot (demo purposes only)
- **personalized_search.ipynb** — Context-aware search agent with optional Tavily integration

## Local Notebooks

Looking to run Hindsight locally instead? See the [parent notebooks directory](../) for the same demos configured for a local Docker instance.
