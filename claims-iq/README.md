# ClaimsIQ — Insurance Claims Triage Agent Demo

An AI agent that processes insurance claims through a multi-step workflow. The agent starts as a "confused rookie" and becomes a "seasoned expert" as [Hindsight](https://github.com/anthropics/hindsight) memories accumulate.

Watch the agent learn coverage rules, adjuster assignments, and escalation patterns in real-time through a pipeline dashboard.

## Quick Start

### 1. Start Hindsight API (port 8888)

```bash
docker run -p 8888:8888 ghcr.io/anthropics/hindsight:latest
```

### 2. Start Backend (port 8000)

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
./run.sh
```

### 3. Start Frontend (port 5173)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 4. Open Browser

Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

## How It Works

The agent processes insurance claims using 6 tools:

1. **Classify** the claim category (auto, property, flood, etc.)
2. **Look up** the policy details
3. **Check coverage** rules for the policy type
4. **Check fraud** indicators
5. **Assign** the right adjuster
6. **Submit** a decision for validation

The system validates each decision against ground truth. If the agent makes a mistake (wrong adjuster, incorrect coverage call), the decision is rejected with feedback — creating learning signal for Hindsight.

## Agent Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **No Memory** | Baseline — agent starts fresh every claim |
| **Recall** | Raw facts from past claims injected before processing |
| **Reflect** | LLM-synthesized knowledge injected |
| **Mental Models** | Full Hindsight mental models with auto-refresh |

## Key Learning Challenges

- **Water damage vs Flood**: Gold policies cover water damage (burst pipe) but NOT flood damage (rain/river). The agent must learn this subtle distinction.
- **Adjuster routing**: 8 adjusters with different specialties and regions. The agent must learn who handles what.
- **Escalation thresholds**: Claims over $50K need a senior adjuster; over $100K need manager review.
- **Fraud detection**: Multiple indicators (near-limit claims, repeated address) route to the fraud specialist.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `LLM_MODEL` | `openai/gpt-4o` | LLM model for the agent |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_URL` | `http://localhost:8888` | Hindsight API URL |
| `BACKEND_PORT` | `8000` | Backend server port |
