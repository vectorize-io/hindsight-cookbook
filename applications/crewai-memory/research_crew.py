"""
Research crew with persistent memory via Hindsight.

This crew has a Researcher and a Writer. Run it multiple times —
the crew remembers what it learned in previous runs.

Usage:
    # First run — the crew has no memories yet
    python research_crew.py "What are the benefits of Rust?"

    # Second run — the crew remembers the Rust research
    python research_crew.py "Compare Rust with Go"

    # Third run — the crew has context from both prior runs
    python research_crew.py "Which language should I pick for a CLI tool?"

    # Reset memory and start fresh
    python research_crew.py --reset

Prerequisites:
    - Hindsight running on localhost:8888 (see README)
    - OpenAI key: export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
